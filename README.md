# SpO2 API: Simulate and Retrieve Blood Oxygen Levels (Flask)
The code provided is a simplified example of a Flask API that simulates retrieving SpO2 (blood oxygen) levels. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

#Description:

This is a simple Flask API that demonstrates how to retrieve SpO2 (blood oxygen) levels. Currently, it simulates random SpO2 values for demonstration purposes.
In a production environment, you'd replace this with code to interact with your healthcare band using the appropriate libraries.

#Features:

Simulates SpO2 data using random values (90-99%)
Provides a /get_spo2 endpoint to retrieve the simulated SpO2 level as JSON data

#How to Use:

Clone this repository or download the code.
Install the required dependencies: pip install Flask
Run the API: python spo2_api.py
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/get_spo2 to retrieve the simulated SpO2 level.

Note:

*This is a simplified example and doesn't interact with real hardware.*
